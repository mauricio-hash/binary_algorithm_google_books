### 🔍 Understanding Efficiency with Binary Search
When we talk about efficient algorithms, binary search is always one of the classics. It's a great example of how a simple strategy can lead to huge performance gains especially when working with large datasets.
Imagine you're looking for a book in a virtual shelf containing thousands of titles sorted alphabetically. Instead of checking one by one, you jump straight to the "middle" of the list, and with just a few comparisons, you find exactly what you're looking for. That's the power of binary search: divide and conquer.

💡 To put this into practice, I wrote a piece of code that simulates a binary search while querying the Google Books API. The idea was to apply the concept to find books efficiently, using sorting and filtering logic, bridging theory and real-world applications.
